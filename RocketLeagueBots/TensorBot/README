TensorBot is a machine learning based Rocket League bot built using Behavioral Cloning (aka 
Imitation Learning).

It uses recorded play data from the Diablo bot to build a neural net that maps the current game
state to the best controller actions. 24 state values get fed into the network and 7 controller 
outputs are pulled out and given to rlbot to control the bot.



bot.py - core TensorBot file
botNN.py - neural net model
exampleRecorder.py - example snippit recording State/Action data
prepTrainingData.py - clean raw data and move to new location
trainTensorBot.py - train and save model





--Where can I find the data you recorded?

Message me (@Soren) on the rlbot discord or send me a discord pm. I'll link the data set since its too big
to transfer via normal methods.



--How can I generate my own recording? 

Take a look at the exampleRecorder.py file I put in the repo, specifically get_output() and __init__().
It shows how to instruct a bot to open a new file, write the data you need to, and in what order. 
Then its just a matter of letting the bot play as long as you need. You'll probably need at least
3 to 4 gigs to train the network. I recommend letting them play while you sleep.



--How do I prep the data recorded?

Modify the prepTrainingData.py to have the paths you want and then run it. It will spit out data
that trainTensorBot.py expects. 



--Can I use replays from calculated.gg instead of these recordings?

Probably not. Caculated.gg doesn’t provide what the controller actions are during the match, 
which is an essential part of Behavioral Cloning. You can try estimating what those actions 
would be or using Behavioral Cloning from Observation but I have no idea how to do either of those.



--Can’t I just generate recordings of a better bot or get them from a pro player and make an
even stronger version of TensorBot?

You can definitely try! However, Behavioral Cloning seems to have difficulties with successfully 
imitating highly dexterous behavior such as dribbling and precise jumps, which many higher-level 
bots and players rely on to win. 



--What if I try to train on recordings of several decent bots together? Will they fuse into a
perfect storm of Kamael-destroying power?

I strongly suspect that doing this will just end up with a confused bot trying to blindly stitch
together different strategies. However you can still try, especially if you think you have ways
to focus on the strengths of each agent.
