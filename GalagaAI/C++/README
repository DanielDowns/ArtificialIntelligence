README for c++ implementation of Galaga AI

This is the greatly improved version of the Python AI I developed. Several major changes were added as a part of the 
C++ part that helped with the performance of the AI:

   -AI never writes to or reads from disk outside of initialization
   -the image of the game used is smaller, meaning less work
   -value-of-hypothetical-position algorithm used to dodge and pick targets has been improved
   
The AI is definitely not perfect though:

  -AI doesn't account for kamakaize ships
  -threat of missiles is sometimes overestimated, leading to an incorrect "hopeless" situation. This causes the AI
      to not dodge an avoidable threat
      
At this point, I'm declaring this project done. It's definitely not perfect, but it was never meant to be.
This was an educational project meant to introduce me to AI and make sure that my intial Python AI was correct. 
I didn't want to hide behind "Python is too slow but I know I'm right", I wanted to prove I was right. 
I was and I am now moving on to a new AI project.
